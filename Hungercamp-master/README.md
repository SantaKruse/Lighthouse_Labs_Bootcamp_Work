Bootcamp meets Hunger Games.
Cohort tributes go through assignments and answer questions to gain points.
For each assignment they complete, more time is added to their death clock.
If they run out of time, they are eliminated from the cohort.
A cannon goes off each time a user logs on and someone has dissappeared / has been eliminated.

A user can also check their stats to see where they stand in the cohort relative to other tributes.
